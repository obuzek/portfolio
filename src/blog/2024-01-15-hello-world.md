Welcome to decoding ink! I'm excited to finally have a space to share my thoughts on software development, technology, and everything in between.

## What to Expect

On this blog, you'll find:

- **Technical deep dives** - Exploring interesting problems and solutions I encounter in my work
- **Project updates** - Progress on open source projects and side ventures
- **Conference recaps** - Notes and reflections from speaking engagements
- **Industry thoughts** - My perspective on trends and developments in software engineering

## Why "Decoding Ink"?

The name reflects what I love most about software development: the process of turning abstract ideas into concrete, working code. There's something magical about taking an idea, breaking it down into its component parts, and reconstructing it as a functional piece of software.

## Stay Connected

Feel free to reach out on [GitHub](https://github.com/oliviabuzek) or [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/oliviabuzek). I'm always happy to chat about code, collaborate on projects, or just connect with fellow developers.

Thanks for visiting, and I hope you find something useful here!
