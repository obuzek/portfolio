After several years of giving talks at conferences and meetups, I've accumulated some lessons that might help others who are starting their speaking journey.

## Start Local

My first talk was at a local meetup with about 20 people. It was terrifying, but it was the perfect low-stakes environment to practice. Local meetups are:

- **Forgiving** - The audience wants you to succeed
- **Small** - Less pressure than a large conference
- **Accessible** - Usually just need to reach out to organizers

## Your Slides Are Not Your Talk

I used to cram everything onto my slides. Now I follow a different approach:

- Slides are **visual aids**, not scripts
- Use large fonts and minimal text
- Let images and diagrams do the heavy lifting
- Your voice carries the story

## Practice Out Loud

Reading through your slides in your head is not practice. You need to:

1. Stand up (if you'll be standing)
2. Speak at full volume
3. Time yourself
4. Record yourself (painful but valuable)

## Handle Q&A Gracefully

The Q&A can be intimidating, but remember:

- "I don't know, but I'll find out" is a valid answer
- Repeat the question for the audience
- It's okay to defer long discussions to after the talk

## Embrace Nervousness

I still get nervous before every talk. I've learned to reframe it: nervousness means you care. That energy, channeled correctly, makes for a more engaging presentation.

## Start Speaking

If you're thinking about speaking, I encourage you to submit to a CFP (Call for Papers) or reach out to a local meetup. The community is welcoming, and you have something valuable to share.
