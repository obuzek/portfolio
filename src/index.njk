      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I've worked at the intersection of computers, language and intelligence for over 15 years. In school, I studied computer science and linguistics, where I became fascinated with the overlap in abstract representations between the way we structure human languages and coding languages.</p>
      <p>My career since has focused on data, machine learning, and AI. I started as what would now be called an MLOps Engineer, where I worked to scale our NLP training processes to serve hundreds of classical ML models. I later led a team to share those models across the company via inner source, then took many of those concepts to work in the trustworthy and responsible AI space. Since generative AI has taken off, I've turned my focus towards innovating new patterns of AI and human interaction.</p>
      <p>I've long had a yen towards creating excellent, well-designed user experiences both for developers and consumers of AI applications. I subscribe to neither the AI hype nor the AI doomerism: I believe that human creativity and AI can coexist, and that builders of AI applications have a responsibility to their users to ensure that humans thrive when using the tools we have built. I am currently investigating how to build generative AI applications that use LLMs efficiently, effectively, and in ways that support the people whose creativity helped make AI happen.</p>
      <p>Welcome. Let's build something cool together.</p>
