summary: >
  AI engineering leader with 15 years of experience refining and opening up siloed AI capabilities. I led work 
  that coalesced 20 years of fragmented NLP development into a single shared library, brought inner source practices to enterprise
  ML, and turned research-grade responsible AI into something product teams could ship.
  I can help you create AI applications that save labor, rather than replace human ingenuity.

# Original summary (pre-2025 revision):
# summary: >
#   Experienced leader of machine learning and responsible AI teams, with an extensive
#   background in collaborative development practices. Highlights include bringing inner
#   source to an enterprise organization, launching reusable libraries around NLP and
#   trustworthy AI, and implementing guardrails for LLMs. Committed to fostering
#   collaboration and ethical practices to drive impact for clients and positive societal outcomes.

  - MLOps & LLMOps
  - Trustworthy & Responsible AI
  - Natural Language Processing
  - Inner Source Transformation
  - ML Strategy
  - Agile Leadership

experience:
  - title: Senior Technical Staff Member - Trustworthy AI Tech Lead
    company: IBM Research - watsonx.ai Platform
    start: 2021-11
    end: present
    highlights:
      - Unified IBM's fragmented Trustworthy AI research (fairness, explainability, robustness) into Watson Trust, a production-ready sklearn-compatible Python library. Previously these existed as separate codebases with incompatible data structures; the unified API made responsible AI practices accessible to product teams who had treated them as too obscure to implement.
      - Founded IBM's Inner Source Program Office in 2021 and led the effort to coalesce 20 years of NLP development into the Python and Java-based Watson NLP library, which became the de facto standard for NLP across IBM in the pre-generative AI era. Won Outstanding Technical Achievement Award and IBM Corporate Award.
      - Developed inner source practices which became a core component of IBM's technical strategy, included in the 2022 Global Technology Outlook, and a precursor to IBM's current open approach to generative AI.
    # Original highlights (pre-2025 revision):
    # - Led productionization of IBM's state-of-the-art Trustworthy / Responsible AI research into LLMOps and MLOps systems
    # - Awarded rank of STSM (requiring 15 executive-level references and committee review) to expand practices as core leader of the watsonx.ai Platform and lead its ethical AI strategy
    # - Won Outstanding Technical Achievement Award and IBM Corporate Award for inner sourcing IBM's first reusable NLP stack, Watson NLP - now the de facto standard for NLP at IBM
    # - Founded Inner Source Program Office at IBM in 2021, now a core component of IBM's technical strategy and included in the Global Technology Outlook for 2022
    # - Developed Watson Trust, a production-ready Python-based sklearn-compatible library for Trustworthy AI
    # - Co-launched internal startup Conveyor.ai for low-code machine learning orchestration

  - title: Senior Engineering Manager
    company: IBM Watson
    start: 2018-05
    end: 2021-11
    highlights:
      - "Managed a team of 10 machine learning engineers across two cross-functional squads: one focused on ML algorithms, one on cloud productionization."
      - Oversaw merger of two major NLP SaaS products, growing organization and onboarding remote teams into integrated matrix management.
      - Stabilized post-acquisition team with high attrition and low morale over one year by reorienting organization to take advantage of new hires' extensive background in machine learning research.
      - "Created Algorithms Guild and Innovation Time to give ML insights a home on the product side, leading directly to a shipped beta feature: explainability for Natural Language Classifier."
      - Developed inner source process for Watson NLP core language technology, allowing NLP and data science experts across IBM to volunteer contributions to the shared library.
